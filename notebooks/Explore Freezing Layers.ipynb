Recombined receptors for antigen encoded by immunoglobulin superfamily domains include T cell receptors and immunoglobulins (antibodies) produced by B cells. The first encounter with antigen elicits a primary immune response that is slow and not of great magnitude. T and B cells selected by antigen become activated and undergo clonal expansion. A fraction of antigen-reactive T and B cells become memory cells, whereas others differentiate into effector cells. The memory cells generated during the primary response enable a much faster and stronger secondary immune response upon subsequent exposures to the same antigen (immunological memory). An example of this is the adaptive immune response found in Mus musculus.',\n",

Certain conditions, such as presence of the antibiotic tetracycline in bacteria or amino acid starvation, may cause slowing or stalling of the ribosome translating the leader peptide. The stalled ribosome masks a region of the mRNA and affects which of two alternative mRNA folded structures will form, therefore controlling whether or not a ribosome will bind and initiate translation of the downstream gene.

Several of these subunits are known dimers, so the total polypeptide count in the multisynthetase complex is at least fifteen. All of the enzymes in this assembly catalyze the same reaction, the covalent attachment of an amino acid to either the 2'- or 3'-hydroxyl of the 3'-terminal adenosine of tRNA, but using different substrates.\",\n",
       "       'An assembly of four or five subunits which form a structure with an extracellular N-terminus and a large loop that together form the ligand binding domain. The C-terminus is intracellular. The ionotropic glutamate receptor complex itself acts as a ligand gated ion channel; on binding glutamate, charged ions pass through a channel in the center of the receptor complex. NMDA receptors are composed of assemblies of NR1 subunits (Figure 3) and NR2 subunits, which can be one of four separate gene products (NR2A-D). Expression of both subunits are required to form functional channels. The glutamate binding domain is formed at the junction of NR1 and NR2 subunits. NMDA receptors are permeable to calcium ions as well as being permeable to other ions. Thus NMDA receptor activation leads to a calcium influx into the post-synaptic cells, a signal thought to be crucial for the induction of NMDA-receptor dependent LTP and LTD.',\n",

       "       'A multisubunit complex composed of two copies of a restriction (R) subunit, two copies of a methylation (M) subunit, and one copy of a specificity (S) subunit. This complex recognizes specific short DNA sequences (through the S subunit), and binds to them. If the recognition site is hemimethylated, the complex acts as a methyltransferase which modifies the recognition site, using S-adenosylmethionine as the methyl donor. Only the M and S subunits are required for this reaction. If the complex binds to an unmethylated recognition site, then the complex translocates the DNA bidirectionally in an ATP-dependent manner. When the translocation is stalled by impact with another complex or unusual DNA structure, the enzyme functions as an endonuclease and cleavage of the DNA will occur, hundreds or thousands of base pairs away from the recognition site. These DNA restriction systems are used by bacteria to defend against phage and other foreign DNA that may enter a cell.',\n",

       "       'A type of transcriptional regulation at the level of early termination. This process can occur only in prokaryotes, where transcription of an operon into messenger RNA and translation of that mRNA into polypeptides occur simultaneously. The general principle is that alternative mRNA secondary structures occur under different physiological conditions such as available amount of a particular amino acid. One set of conditions favors early termination of transcription. In the classic example of the trp biosynthesis operon, translation of the gene for a short, trp-containing polypeptide called the trp operon leader peptide pauses either at a trp codon (if tryptophan is scarce) or the stop codon (if trp is readily available). In the former situation transcription continues, but in the latter a Rho-independent terminator forms and reduces, or attenuates, expression of the tryptophan biosynthesis genes. Although the polypeptides encoded by leader peptide genes appear not to be stable once their translation is complete, it is suggested by recent studies that their nascent polypeptide chains interact specifically with ribosomes, specific uncharged tRNAs, or other cellular components to inhibit release at the stop codon and improve the function of transcriptional attenuation as a regulatory switch.',\n",

It uses a selective autophagy receptor protein Nbr1, which is an ortholog of mammalian NBR1, and is remotely related to S. cerevisiae Cvt pathway receptor protein Atg19. Similar to the Cvt pathway, the cargos transported by this pathway are hydrolases, which presumably contribute to the hydrolytic activities in the vacuole lumen. Different from the Cvt pathway, this pathway does not require the macroautophagy machinery, but instead relies on the ESCRT machinery for cargo sequestration. This pathway is observed in the fission yeast S. pombe.',\n",

While some of these ring complexes may form independently of RNA, many only form in association with their target RNA. In addition to Lsm-family proteins, many of these complexes contain additional protein members. Members of this family of complexes include the snRNPs which comprise the majority of the spliceosome.

       "       'A stress-inducible protein catabolic pathway that promotes protein quality control by accelerating the degradation of misfolded ER membrane and cytosolic proteins, as well as native proteins. The pathway starts with the activation, by stress, of the Nma111p/Ynm3p serine protease, which cleaves the stress-induced hydrophilin Roq1p, resulting in the generation of a Roq1p cleavage product that selectively interacts with Ubr1p, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Interaction with the Ubr1p type-1 substrate binding site reprograms the substrate specificity of this ubiquitin ligase resulting in the selective proteasome-mediated degradation of misfolded and native proteins. The pathway ends with degradation of the protein by the cytoplasmic proteasome. Currently, NMA111, ROQ1, UBR1, RAD6, and CDC48 are considered to be involved in this quality control pathway.',\n",
